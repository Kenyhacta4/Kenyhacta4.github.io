def safe_copy(input_str):
    """
    Safely copies input to a buffer of fixed size.
    Implements buffer size limitation to prevent buffer overflow issues.
    
    Key Algorithmic Step:
    - Check the input string length against a fixed buffer size.
    - If within the limit, copy to the buffer safely.
    - If it exceeds, reject the input with an error message.

    Data Structure Efficiency:
    - Strings in Python are immutable and slicing is O(n) where n is the slice size.
    - This ensures the operation is efficient and safe for small buffer sizes.

def process_task_queue():
    """
    Manages a task queue and processes tasks in First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.
    This simulates task management in a sequential processing environment.

    Key Algorithmic Step:
    - Use a list as the task queue.
    - Pop the first element (index 0) repeatedly to process tasks in FIFO order.

    Data Structure Efficiency:
    - Lists are used for task queues.
    - `pop(0)` removes the first element and shifts the rest, which is O(n) for each operation.
    - While `pop(0)` is less efficient for large queues, it is sufficient for small task lists.

    Main function to handle user input and task queue management.

    Key Algorithmic Step:
