## üìö Alignment with Course Outcomes

Throughout my Computer Science program and the enhancement of these artifacts, I have demonstrated mastery of the following course outcomes:
	1.	Building Collaborative Environments
By creating artifacts that focus on secure coding, such as preventing SQL injection and handling sensitive data efficiently, I showcased my ability to enable diverse audiences to collaborate effectively. These enhancements provide clear, adaptable solutions that empower decision-making in real-world scenarios.
	2.	Professional Communication
The ePortfolio, along with detailed documentation and narratives, reflects my ability to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality written and visual communications. Each artifact includes concise documentation, clean code, and user-friendly interfaces that cater to specific audiences.
	3.	Design and Evaluation of Computing Solutions
Enhancements such as input validation and buffer overflow prevention involved algorithmic problem-solving and trade-off management. I carefully evaluated multiple approaches to ensure the most efficient and effective solutions were implemented.
	4.	Application of Innovative Techniques
Using innovative tools such as Python libraries, MongoDB, and performance logging, I implemented enhancements that align with industry standards. These techniques delivered value to the artifacts by improving functionality, usability, and security.
	5.	Developing a Security Mindset
Security has been at the forefront of my enhancements. From preventing SQL injection to adding secure logging and authentication mechanisms, my work demonstrates a strong focus on exposing vulnerabilities, mitigating risks, and ensuring data privacy and resource security.
